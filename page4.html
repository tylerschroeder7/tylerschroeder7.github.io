             <h1>About Us</h1>
             <p>Checkpoint Entertainment is a company that was founded by Tyler Schroeder.
             Tyler was a gamer his entire life and wanted to create a company that put gamers first.</p>
             <p>Other companies focus mainly on making a profit, but at Checkpoint, we want to build a sense of community with our customers.
             We want everyone to feel like we are more than just another game store. We put a focus on commecting to our customers and taking
           their feedback seriously. Our goal is and always will be to put gamers first, because we, ourselves, are gamers.</p>
           <p>As a company just starting out, our current selection is thin, but over time we hope to gain an extensive library that
           can have something for gamers of all types.</p>
